# Using Keras via Docker

This directory contains `Dockerfile` to make it easy to get up and running with
Keras via [Docker](http://www.docker.com/).

## Installing Docker

General installation instructions are
[on the Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/installation/), but we give some
quick links here:

* [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/): [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox)
* [ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/)

## Running the container

We are using `Makefile` to simplify docker commands within make commands.

Build the container and start a jupyter notebook

    $ make notebook

Build the container and start an iPython shell

    $ make ipython

Build the container and start a bash

    $ make bash

Switch between Theano and TensorFlow

    $ make notebook BACKEND=theano
    $ make notebook BACKEND=tensorflow

Mount a volume for external data sets

    $ make DATA=~/mydata

Prints all make tasks

    $ make help

You can change Theano parameters by editing `/docker/theanorc`.
